# UI5 Web Components Laminar Project Structure

This project is organized into several main modules:

1. **ui5-webcomponents**: Contains the Scala.js facades for the original UI5 Web Components
   - Located in the [ui5-webcomponents](mdc:ui5-webcomponents) directory
   - These are type-safe Scala.js bindings to the underlying JavaScript components

2. **ui5-webcomponents-laminar**: Contains the Laminar-specific integrations
   - Located in the [ui5-webcomponents-laminar](mdc:ui5-webcomponents-laminar) directory
   - Provides a more idiomatic Scala/Laminar API on top of the Scala.js facades

3. **website**: Documentation and examples site
   - Located in the [website](mdc:website) directory
   - Contains examples of component usage in [website/src/website/views/docs](mdc:website/src/website/views/docs)

## Build System

The project uses Mill as its build tool, with configuration defined in [build.mill](mdc:build.mill).
