    * By default, a form item spans 12 cells, fully divided between its label (4 cells) and field (8 cells), with no
    * empty space at the end. The `emptySpan` provides additional layout flexibility by defining empty space at the form
    * itemâ€™s end.

    * **Note:**
    *   - The maximum allowable empty space is 10 cells. At least 1 cell each must remain for the label and the field.
    *   - When `emptySpan` is specified (greater than 0), ensure that the combined value of `emptySpan` and `labelSpan`
    *     does not exceed 11. This guarantees a minimum of 1 cell for the field.
